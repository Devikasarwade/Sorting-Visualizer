# Sorting-Visualizer
This program is designed to visually demonstrate the working of the Bubble Sort algorithm in real-time using Python. It employs Matplotlib to create an animated bar chart that updates dynamically to show the sorting process step by step. The visualization provides an educational and intuitive way to understand how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.

Purpose:
This script visually demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm using Matplotlib for plotting the bar heights in real-time. It's suitable for environments like Google Colab, where GUI libraries like Tkinter cannot be used.

Code Breakdown:
1. Importing Libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import time

matplotlib.pyplot: Used for plotting the bar chart to represent the array being sorted.
random: Generates random integers for the initial dataset.
time: Introduces a delay to create an animation effect.

3. Bubble Sort Visualization Function

def bubble_sort_visualization(data):
    n = len(data)
    for i in range(n - 1):  # Outer loop for each pass
        for j in range(n - i - 1):  # Inner loop for comparison
            if data[j] > data[j + 1]:  # Compare adjacent elements
                data[j], data[j + 1] = data[j + 1], data[j]  # Swap if out of order
                visualize(data)  # Visualize the current state of the array
                time.sleep(0.1)  # Pause for 0.1 seconds to slow down visualization
Outer loop: Iterates n-1 times, where n is the number of elements. This is because the last element gets sorted in each pass.
Inner loop: Compares adjacent elements (data[j] and data[j + 1]) and swaps them if theyâ€™re in the wrong order.
visualize(data): Called after every swap to redraw the bar chart showing the updated array.
time.sleep(0.1): Adds a delay to make the changes visible as an animation.

4. Visualization Function

def visualize(data):
    plt.bar(range(len(data)), data, color="yellow")  # Draws the array as a bar chart
    plt.pause(0.05)  # Briefly pauses to update the plot
    plt.clf()  # Clears the previous plot to redraw
plt.bar: Creates a bar chart where the indices are on the x-axis, and values (heights) are on the y-axis.
plt.pause(0.05): Allows the current plot to be shown for a short duration before being cleared.
plt.clf(): Clears the figure so the next frame can be drawn without overlap.

5. Generate Random Data

data = [random.randint(10, 100) for _ in range(20)]
Creates a list of 20 random integers between 10 and 100.

6. Initialize the Plot

plt.ion()  # Turn on interactive mode for live updates
visualize(data)  # Show the initial array
plt.ion(): Enables Matplotlib's interactive mode for dynamic updating of plots.
visualize(data): Displays the initial state of the array.

7. Call Bubble Sort Visualization

bubble_sort_visualization(data)
plt.ioff()  # Turn off interactive mode after sorting
plt.show()  # Display the final sorted array
bubble_sort_visualization(data): Sorts the array and visualizes the process.
plt.ioff(): Disables interactive mode.
plt.show(): Displays the final sorted bar chart.


Output Explanation
Initially, a bar chart displays the random, unsorted array.
As the sorting progresses, the bars are updated to show the swapping of elements in real-time.
After all passes of the Bubble Sort algorithm, the bars are arranged in ascending order.

# Sorting-Visualizer
This program is designed to visually demonstrate the working of the Bubble Sort algorithm in real-time using Python. It employs Matplotlib to create an animated bar chart that updates dynamically to show the sorting process step by step. The visualization provides an educational and intuitive way to understand how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
